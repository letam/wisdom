# Fragility
Fragility is the state of being easily broken, the opposite of durability.
Fragile persons are poisonous weak people looking to bring their world down to their weakness as opposed to strong people who are eager to improvement themselves as necessary to conquer the world's challenges.

## Harm
Fragile people are harmful, toxic.
The harm is resultant from self-serving emotional objectives in contradiction to personal relationships.
In healthy relationships people mutually coexist in a symbiotic manner where they fulfill their own needs through positive contributions that strengthen the relationship.
This is a form of brutal tough love, because it can mean telling somebody something they don't want to hear in order to steer them away from harm.
For example good parents are quick to tell their children harsh things while weak parents lie to their children, or simply neglect them, with soft half truths as necessary to reduce effort.

Imagine a lifeguard attempting to save a drowning person.
Drowning people are often panicky because they are in great fear from a loss of control and that lost control is killing them almost immediately.
The life guard is there to save the life of that drowning person, but if that panicking person grabs the life guard in a restrictive way they could both drown.
It is necessary for the life guard to retain control, which may require hurting or restraining the panicky person.
The worst case scenario is that both people drown.
The best case scenario is that both people survive.
If the panicky person drowns it is not the worst thing that can happen, because they were about to drown anyways.
If both people do survive the best case scenario is absolutely achieved.
If the life guard has to break the nose of the panicky person in order to control them then that injury is irrelevant so long as they both survive.
Like a drowning person a fragile person will attempt to pull you down for their own self-serving needs.

## Toxic Behaviors
The behavior driving fragility is a loss of trust that begins from the self and drifts outward.
This creates an emotional vacuum and the purpose of fragile people is to aggressively fill that internalized void through external gratification.
Fragility is often accompanied by an extremely poor, possibly absent or damaged, capability for self-reflection.
If a person were readily capable of self-reflecting on their current emotional state they would more clearly identify the disconnect between their internalized emotional concerns and their externally facing motivations, thus identifying their own fragility.

The most common behavior associated with self-serving qualities is narcissism.
Other behaviors include unwanted aggressive inter-personal competition, such as somebody competing for superiority in an unstated dominance hierarchy as though public displays of their competition win them social gratification.

Although narcissism is the ultimate indicate of selfishness it is not the ultimate relationship killer.
Narcissists will often curate and maintain relationships with great care because it serves their own emotional needs at great expense and trauma to all other persons involved.
The ultimate relationship killer is contempt.
Contempt is a feeling of disdain, dishonor, insignificance, or inferiority of a person in a relationship.
Contempt arises from an emotional position resulting in a feeling of superiority which logically regards the other persons in the relationship as too insignificant to be worthy of the time, energy, or effort required to maintain any relationships much less a positive and beneficial relationship.

Typically the person with the feelings of contempt will be the person to abandon the relationship, but if not its time to break things off and move on.
Once contempt sets in things are already in a death spiral and nothing positive or worthy of salvage will remain.
This realization is especially hard for the person(s) on the other end of a contemptuous person, but they are likely working extra hard to keep the relationship alive on life support.
That extra effort is all for naught as the person with contempt doesn't care, because they are only looking after their own interests.
Any attempt to maintain what's not valued results in you being the doormat that's about to be thrown away, which makes a fragile person feel strong from a position of power.
Don't let that fragile abuser convince you of some illusory fragile.
Be strong and move on to greener pastures.

## Infected Culture
It is possible that fragility be more widely present than an individual concern, such as a cultural phenomenon.
This is common when the weakest members, emotionally, of a group are most eagerly driving the leadership concerns.
The common cliche is: *the squeaky wheel gets the grease*.
In organizations with weak leadership it is more expedient to appease those who whine the loudest at cost to everyone else.
Strong leaders must account for the motivations behind suggestions and complaints to determine their validity to the business and/or the group culture and must demand opposing counter-points.

Cultures infected with fragility can be cured by dramatically raising standards.
This will be painful and many people will leave, but the result is well worth the struggle.
Such pain can be lowered when strong leaders demonstrate empathy and a frequent willingness to invest in the challenges facing their employees in addition to their regular responsibilities.

## Confidence
Contrary to arrogance confidence is a collection of emotional dispositions that are often not deliberately communicated, because its an internalizing quality.
Confidence, both high and low confidence, is then indirectly communicated through actions, non-verbal communication, and patterns of behavior.

Fragile people are individuals with negative confidence.
Confidence is an honest belief or trust in the capabilities of the self or a device immediately at use to the self.
Knowing that think of confidence according to a baseline where no confidence is in the middle, a state of neutrality.
Above that baseline is positive confidence and below that is negative confidence.
No confidence is different from negative confidence, and typically exists due to a lack of experience or apprehension at a new encounter.

People with high confidence believe in their own ability to accomplish a task.
People with negative confidence are people with deep trust issues that resonate from the self and feed off those around them like an emotional parasite.
Negative confidence is responsible for a variety of harmful behaviors such as narcissism, pathological deception, cheating, and so forth.
Negative confidence is the key to identify fragile people.

For example a software developer new to a programming concept will likely have no confidence in their ability to perform that new concept.
That person will grow their confidence over time through practice as their familiarity and experience grows.
People with negative confidence, however, will attempt to avoid the new concept out of fear or disgust, and so their confidence will never increase.
Furthermore, the non-cognitive emotional state driving their fear/disgust response will redirect their cognitive decisions and communication towards areas of familiarity or comfort and away from the immediate subject.

## Ethics
For a concise examination of ethics please see my document on [Leadership in Software](./Leadership_In_Software.md#ethics).
A fragile person is not capable of adhering to an ethical standard.
Ethical standards establish a common framework of accepted behavior for the attainment of a collective goal, such as delivery of a key business objective.
Fragile people are focused upon self-serving emotional goals in direct conflict to organizational goals.

For example a fragile person may strongly advocate for use of a tool or programming concept they know to be harmful in order to avoid a fear of failure.
The harms for the organization may include a loss of execution performance, slower task completion, loss of software quality, increased security violations, and more.
This behavior becomes apparent when the person is confronted with evidence of harm, according to measures or other objective criteria, and they irrationally discard the evidence out of hand.

## Be a Leader
Don't let fragile people drive the bus.
Be firm and resolute and stand on the side of evidence.
Perform a variety of frequent measures to determine the operating conditions and product quality of your organization.
Set baselines of accepted quality.

Strong leaders provide sufficient purpose, direction, and motivation to steer the organization towards greater accountability and delivery.
This means spending time with your people raise up the people with no or low confidence.
It also means identifying the people with negative confidence and separating them from the rest of the group.
People with negative confidence must be counseled about their harmful behavior and provided the opportunity to improve.
If after a satisfactory period of time the persons with negative confidence cannot demonstrate improvement, or they regress, they must be separated from the organization.
That separation is necessary for the greater health and culture of the organization, similar to surgically removing a tumor.
Surgery is unpleasant, but cancer spreading across your body is more unpleasant.

## Trust
The enemy of fragility is trust.
Trust means empowering your people to be more than they currently are, which may result in a failure.
This requires mentorship on the part of a leader and a bit of bravery on the part of the subordinate.
Good leaders seek to reassure their people to properly evaluate risks and take minor risks.
That also means that good leaders provide a safe working environment where people know they have the support to do their best when evaluating risk.
People not capable of accepting or extending trust must be identified as a potential of toxicity.

## Becoming Less Fragile
To be less fragile a person must invest in honesty as deep internalizing emotional quality.
Low fragility cultures encourage brutal honesty among their members.
It takes great strength to communicate your weaknesses and insecurities, and a strong culture of openness to receive that communication necessarily to improve upon it for everyone's benefit.
This requires thick skin as people around you who are eager to help and support you may tell you things that are hurtful.
This is why trust is so important, because strong honest relationships demand a minimal amount of emotional security in order to work effectively.
People with thin skin, who are unable to build trust sufficiently, will take many forms of honest commentary as a personal attack that challenges their negative confidence.
