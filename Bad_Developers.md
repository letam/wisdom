# Bad Developers
Many of the other documents in this repository are focused on how to become a better developer.  This document is instead focused on not becoming a bad developer.

At the time of this writing I have been developing web technologies for nearly 20 years.  In this time I have encountered many bad developers or people advocating very bad practices.  The most unfortunate part of this is that the underlying behaviors and motivations comprise a few commonly repeated categories and all of this bad behavior can be easily avoided.

## Summary (skippin to the end)
To be a great developer be honest with yourself in motivation and purpose, and then dominate the skill with aggressive practice.

**There is no such thing as technology failure.  There are only natural disasters and bad human decisions.**

## Faulty Purpose
Disdain is by far the most common failure I have encountered as a web developer.  Advanced formal training of web technologies is rare.

### University Fresh Developers
The most common scenario for producing a developer is to train a student in a university environment a variety of skills but primarily focuse on developing in a language like C++ (or some derivative).  Web technologies are now prolific so they might be touched upon in a computer science elective class.

From a university perspective this makes sense because there are something like 11x more Java jobs in the marketplace than JavaScript jobs and those Java jobs tend to pay more.  The challenge with this path is that although factually accurate it doesn't often align with the reality of entering the marketplace for that first big career.  It is often easier to get an entry level job as a web developer than as a Java developer due to lower barrier to entry.

The most commonly observed behavior I have noticed from people just entering the market as web developer with a formal computer science education is that web technologies weren't the focus of their education and web technology skills are either less valuable or less important.

### Java Developers
The second most common scenario in which web development work occurs in older large corporations is to simply retask experienced developers from unrelated technologies without any formal training.  From the employers perspective this makes sense because experienced senior web developers are rare.  So rare that they are thought of as magical purple unicorns in the job market.  It takes time to develop a skill and get good at anything, which unfortunately means throwing money at the problem doesn't provide an instant fix.

Training costs money, developers are expensive, and developers are paid to solve challenging problems.  That said, there is no motivation on the part of an employer to invest in training before transitioning a Java developer to JavaScript work.  Employers will silently imply the developer will just as easily account for their own short comings and simply solve the problem of transfering into a great unknown.

### Disdain and Contempt
**Contempt** is to regard a subject as lesser or worthless and **disdain** is contempt in action.

In both of the prior described scenarios developers are performing work they aren't prepared to perform.  The common result is a series of behaviors collectively referrred to as *cognitive dissonance*.  Cognitive dissonance is present when multiple conflicting attitudes motivate a decision and frequently results in qualifications referred to as *cognitive conservatism*.  Cognitive conservatism is the behavior of justifying a series of decisions and actions contrary to available evidence.  In other words, when failure occurs it isn't the fault of the untrained developer but rather perceived weakness in the technology, as observed by the developer, thereby shifting blame.  Regardless, failure is still failure.

These behaviors present severe second and third order effects.  Essentially these behaviors produce distrust and bias that negatively impact success metrics, product quality, and speed of action.  Worse still is that such behaviors will result in an inferior product and degrade the interpersonal work environment.

### Solving the Contempt Problem
Fortunately, these problems can be solved through strong leadership.  Provide mentorship and quick resolution when a developer writes bad code.  I have seen the most drastic adjustments in the behaviors of established developers by simply providing a quick bit of assistance and education around a small piece of code.  Politely, directly, and immediately correct a developer when they speak unqualified commentary with regards to either superiority or inferiority.  These sorts of comments tend to come from deeper unspoken beliefs, but a firm rebuttal that such opinions aren't acceptable may cause a person to rethink their commentary before the negativity can inspire other people.

## Over Reliance Upon Terminology
I have encountered numerous developers who need explicit language to make sense of an abstract subject.  This behavior is observed when the human expressed written language becomes more important than the subject it describes.  Some examples may include named programming patterns, definitions of terms, or some forms of explicit instructions.

The problem is an inverse of *linguistic relativity*.  That is a fancy term that suggests the structure and description of a human language shapes the thoughts of a person.  In this case, however, people use linguistic symbolism to encode abstract concepts to memory using a mnemonic device as a key to aid in recall, which then shapes their perception of how to write and options available.  This technique doesn't translate to competency in a skill as it is slow, distracting, and cannot be used with multiple competing concepts simultaneously.  To be competent in any skill a person must be able to reason upon the abstract nature of the skill directly whether that skill is writing code, playing a piano, or even just driving a car.

Good code speaks for itself.  Aside from brief comments and minor notes good code doesn't require explicit human written communication to be read and understood.  Code isn't written for human consumption, as in a novel.  Code is written to supply instructions to computers.  Code is abstract.  Writing code is a skill that requires practice to account for and reason upon the subject matter directly.

There are many developers who are either incapable or unwilling to practice programming sufficiently to attain a solid grasp upon code directly.  These people are either new to the given skill or are simply bad developers.  Unfortunately the only solution to this problem is to spend long periods of time in practice solving hard problems.

## Wishful Thinking
Wishful thinking is a common problem with writing JavaScript, particularly among developers who have some prior experience or education writing unrelated code.  Wishful thinking is a cognitive bias that results between conflicts of desire and capability.

The primary way wishful thinking manifests when Java developers immediately jump into JavaScript is perceptions on how the code is to be structured.  The syntax of both languages is very similar, which could lead a rational person to falsely consider that both languages are similar even if directly informed to the contrary.  The challenge is that learning a new language takes a lot of practice and a person cannot reasonably forget prior attained skills, which results in a form of selection bias in how a new language should be written.  These sorts of opinions are common and tend to be pervasive even in the face of conflicting evidence.

Another form of wishful thinking is present when developers set falsly weak expectations and execute accordingly.  There is a common bias that web technologies are weaker, slower, easier, or less capable than other computing environments or languages, and thus deserves a lower level of consideration or effort contrary to any evidence.  As an example I frequently hear about how slow JavaScript is for a programming language, when the current evidence indicates JavaScript is several times faster than most programming languages and only a couple slower than the fastest langauges.

The solution for wishful thinking is to hold people accountable for the quality of their work.  If developers fail to perform to an expected level of quality and are counseled to such they with either revise their perceptions or face further and harsher discipline.
